Iâ€™m currently the Tech Lead at [Lavita](https://www.lavita.ai) where I work with an interdisciplinary team on several internal innovative initiatives related to data privacy, MPC, TEE, machine learning in the financial, biomedical, clinical, and biological domains. I published many [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V4Y4ETQAAAAJ) in these areas. In 2016, my first-authored paper [PRINCESS](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/6/871/2605879) was published in Bioinformatics and it is regarded as the first sgx application publication and my team was granted the Intel SGX outstanding award.

Prior to joining Lavita, I worked at Novo Vivo as the Chief Scientist, Xiaomi USA Inc as a Senior Research Scientist, at Centromere as a cofounder and pricinpal scientist, ASM as an algorithm engineer. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Oklahoma under the supervision of [Dr. Samuel Cheng](https://www.ou.edu/coe/ece/faculty_directory/dr_cheng), followed by a postdoctoral postion at department of biomedical informatics at UCSD supervised by [Dr. Xiaoqian Jiang](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/xiaoqian-jiang.htm). My past working areas include data privacy, cryptography, MPC, TEE, machine learning and computer vision.
